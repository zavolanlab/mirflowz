"""Filter multimappers in a SAM file by indel count.

This script uses the pysam library to open the input SAM file and iterates
over each alignment in it. It is assumed that the file is ordered by query
name. For each alignment, it checks if it is a secondary or supplementary
alignment, if it is, it skips to the next alignment. Otherwise, it adds the
alignment to a list storing all alignments with the same query name.
If the current query changes, it selects the best alignment(s) from the list
of current alingments and writes them to the standard output. Current query
and current alignments list are reset to the new query and alignment
respectively.
Finally, if there are any remaining alignments in the current alignments
list and selects the best alignment(s) for those queries, writing them to
standard output. If --nh is set, all query names are modified to include the
NH tag after an underscore.

Input:
    input_sam_file: Path to the input SAM file, ordered by query name.

Output:
    standard output: Filtered SAM file

Functions:
    parse_arguments():
        Command-line arguments parser
    count_indels(pysam.AlignedSegment):
        Count the number of indels in an alignment based on its CIGAR string.
    find_best_alignments(list[pysam.AlignedSegment]):
        Find alignments with less indels
    write_output(list[pysam.AlignedSegment]):
        Write the output to the standard output (stdout).
    main(Path):
        Filter multimappers by indels count.
